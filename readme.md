# RadixConvertPractice

I programmed this minimal software to help me calculate numbers to convert to different bases (classic bases - such as binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal).

It's a portable program and it only needs [dotnet framework 4 runtime](https://dl2.soft98.ir/soft/n/NET.Framework.4.x86-x64.rar?1713997359) as it's dependency.

Download the program executable file from releases page [(link to latest release)](https://github.com/AliAlmasi/RadixConvertPractice/releases/latest).
