# RadixConvertPractice

I programed this minimal software to help me calculate numbers to convert to different bases (classic bases - such as binary (2), octal (8), decimal (10), and hexadecimal (16) bases).

It is a portable program and it only needs [dotnet framework 4 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net40-offline-installer) as it's dependency.

> "dotnet framework 4 runtime" offline installer (for both 32 & 64 bit systems) is included in this repo [`dotNetFx40_Full_x86_x64.exe`](https://github.com/AliAlmasi/RadixConvertPractice/releases/latest/download/dotNetFx40_Full_x86_x64.exe)
